 Welcome to GaliDodge!

The object of this game is to dodge the blocks coming down. As you progress through levels, the rate at which the blocks come down increases. The longer you last the higher you score. 

The speed will change after a predetermined time. When exactly will this happen you ask? Well it won’t be fun if I tell you now! 

Use your arrow keys to move side to side to avoid the blocks. You only get one chance. If you collide you’ll have to start over!

Enjoy! 

Built Using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The P5Js Library was also used to control acceleration rates more efficiently.

The struggles will be rendering a number of walls and randomly positioning to make the game challenging and engaging.
